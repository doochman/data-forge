You got it! Here's a professional and developer-friendly `README.md` for your **data ingestion stack**. It includes setup instructions, key commands, and helpful tips to get your whole stack running locally with Docker, Jenkins, Mage, Kafka, Flink, Beam, and more.

## 📦 Data Ingestion Stack

This monorepo contains a modular data ingestion stack powered by:

- 🧠 [Mage](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai) – data pipeline orchestration
- 🌀 Apache Kafka & Zookeeper – real-time messaging
- ⚡ Apache Flink – real-time stream processing
- 🛠 Apache Beam (with Flink runner) – unified batch & stream pipelines
- 📓 Jupyter – data exploration
- 🧾 Kafka Schema Registry
- 🔌 Kafka Connect – external source/sink connectors
- 🏦 PostgreSQL – example storage layer
- 📊 Grafana + Prometheus – monitoring and observability
- 🧪 Jenkins – CI/CD pipeline
-     Airflow - Pipeline Orchestration

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/data-ingestion-stack.git
cd data-ingestion-stack
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Customize as needed (Postgres credentials, ports, etc.)

---

## 🐳 1. Start the Full Stack

### With Docker Compose:

```bash
make up
```

> This command builds and starts all core services defined in the docker-compose.yml:

- Mage
- Kafka
- Flink (JobManager and TaskManager)
- Beam
- Jenkins
- Airflow (Webserver, Scheduler)
- Postgres
- Zookeeper
 
## 2. Initialize Airflow (Run Once)

```bash
make airflow-init
```

This sets up the Airflow database and creates an admin user. Run this only the first time after the stack starts.


## 🚪 Access Ingestion Bridge

A beautiful status dashboard for your data stack:

```bash
make bridge
```

### View Logs

```bash
make logs
```

## 🧪 CI/CD with Jenkins

This project includes a Jenkins pipeline defined in `Jenkinsfile`.

To test locally:

```bash
docker-compose up jenkins
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## ✅ Next Steps

- 🧪 Add your Mage pipelines in `/mage`
- 🔁 Add Beam jobs to `/beam/pipeline`
- 🔌 Connect Kafka Connect to external sources (PostgreSQL, S3, etc.)
- 🚢 Extend Jenkins to push images or deploy to a cluster

## 📦 Available Examples

- [Stock Price Streaming](examples/stock-price-streaming) – Collects live market data, publishes to Kafka, processes with Beam, writes to Iceberg
